For my information system project, I would like to create a database containing information on different soccer teams and players, along with their statistics. The potential users would be fans that are interested in keeping up with their team's league standings, or fans of specific players who would like to keep track of specific statistics. There will be tables for players, teams, international teams, leagues, and tournaments. I think that this would be an idea that could be used in a web app as a side-project.

My overall goal for the web app that would be created along with this database would be an app that takes in statistics about each team/roster, and creates heuristics to attempt to predict upcoming matches. I think this would be interesting to try to create logic behind the app so as to have an 80% or greater match prediction rate.
