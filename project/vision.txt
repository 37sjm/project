For my information system project, I would like to create a database containing information on different soccer teams and players, along with their statistics. The potential users would be fans that are interested in keeping up with their team's league standings, or fans of specific players who would like to keep track of specific statistics. There will be tables for players, teams, international teams, leagues, and tournaments. I think that this would be an idea that could be used in a web app as a side-project.
