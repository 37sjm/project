	1. Chapter 3 (focus primarily on Sections 3.1-3.2)
		a. Who invented the relational data model? When and where did they do their work?
			i. Edgar F. Codd invented the relational model in 1969.
			ii. Worked at IBM.
		b. Explain the following terms: relation, attribute, domain, n-tuple, NULL value, keys (primary, foreign, candidate, super), referenced and referencing records.
			i. Relation - A table containing columns (table)
			ii. Attribute - A database field (Column)
			iii. Domain - a data domain refers to all the values which a data element may contain.
			iv. N-tuple - a set of data (row)
			v. Keys - unique to the entity, used to identify.
			vi. Reference - data objects relevant to transactions , data that define the set of permissible values to be used by other data fields
		c. Are tuples in a relation ordered? How about attribute values in a tuple? Explain why or why not.
			i. Tuples are a set, they do not have order. A relation attempts to represent facts at a logical or abstract level in groups, not in order.
		d. Can attributes have multiple values in a single n-tuple? Why or why not?
			i. No, because there would be no other way to identify which "version" of that attribute you wanted to specify.
	2. Chapter 4 (focus primarily on Sections 4.1-4.2 & 4.4) — Make sure that you know how to:
		a. Create tables with specified constraints.
			i. Example:
				1) SQL> CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
   ID   INT              NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
   AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
   SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),       
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
		b. Use the DML commands: INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE.
			i. Insert
				1) INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...valueN);
			ii. Delete
				1) DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];
			iii. Update
				1) UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2...., columnN = valueN
WHERE [condition];
		c. Understand the ON DELETE actions: SET NULL, CASCADE.
			i. Set Null - sets the corresponding records in the child table to null
			ii. ON DELETE CASCADE - delete the child table when the parent table is deleted
		d. Write single-and-multi-table queries — We assumed this in lab 1 because it was covered in CS 262; if necessary, review the basic commands in Section 4.3.
