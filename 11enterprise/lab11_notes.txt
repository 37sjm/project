c. How do the external librarires in the project pane relate to J2SE and J2EE?
	The external libraries include jdk 1.8 which is the Java 8 (J2SE) library, as well as the GlassFish library which is important for creating this enterprise architecture.

d. At what tier does this application run?
	I believe that this application would run on the Web tier, as it's goal is to allow us to retrieve database information through the web.

e. What server does this step use to server up your application? This uses localhost:8080 which is simply using this machine as a "local host" for the server. This differs from a regular server as other machines are unable to access my local host (at least as far as I know.)

f. What is a WAR file?
	A WAR file is a JAR file used to distribute JavaServer Pages, Servlets, classes, etc.

g. What's the difference between explode and non-exploded war files?
	Non-exploded war files are the unzipped directories that you can have the server deploy, rather than packaging up the files and putting that package onto the server.

h. Compare and contrast EAR and WAR artifacts.
	WAR files contain the Servlet classes, JSP files, etc. whereas EAR files contain both JAR and WAR files and more or less contain the entire J2EE project.


11.2.b What library does this application use for REST support?
	The JAX-RS library is used.
